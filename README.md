# Advanced SQLi - A TryHackMe Room
Status: 🚧 This room is currently under review by the TryHackMe team. It is not publicly listed on the platform yet, but it is fully functional and can be accessed for solving using the direct link below.

### 📖 Overview
Welcome to "Advanced SQLi"! This is a hands-on lab I created to teach and test intermediate to advanced SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The challenges in this room are designed to move beyond the basics and into more complex, real-world exploitation scenarios.
